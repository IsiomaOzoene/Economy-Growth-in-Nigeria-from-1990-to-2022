Insights and observation

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a measure of a country's economic health. It represents the total monetary or market value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period.
GDP at 2010 Constant Basic Prices
This measure of GDP adjusts for inflation by using the prices of goods and services from a specific base year (in this case, 2010. By using constant prices, we can accurately assess economic growth and decline over time without the distortion caused by inflation.
GDP at 2010 Constant Market Prices
This measure of GDP also adjusts for inflation, but it takes into account the market prices of goods and services in the base year. It's similar to GDP at constant basic prices, but it includes the effects of indirect taxes and subsidies.

Gross Domestic Product (Billion Naira) in three Sectors:
The analysis showed there was significant changes in the GDP of each sector (Agriculture, Industry and Services), which showed how Nigeria had neglected the agricultural sector, which was the lowest from 1990 to 2015, but began improving faster than the industry sector from 2016 to 2022. The service sector has always been the most important sector for generating high GDP in Nigeria, and according to 2022 data which has the highest GDP, we had an estimate of 41,353 million naira in GDP for the service industry, 19,091 million naira in GDP for the agricultural sector, and 14,196 million in GDP for the industrial sector. 

Inflation Rate from 1990 to 2022:
When inflation rises, the purchasing power of the currency decreases. This means that you can buy fewer goods and services with the same amount of money. 
The visualization showed that the inflation rate was at the highest around 1995 with72.84%, and there was a significant drop to 10.70% in the year 1997. From 2022 Nigeria's inflation rate was 18.90%, up 5.71% from 2020 Inflation, for 2020 was 13.20%, up 1.85% from 2019. 11.40% in 2019 was a 0.7% decrease from 2018. 12.09%, a decrease of 4.43% from 2017. 
Further personal research showed that the as of October 2024, Nigeria's inflation rate is 33.88%. This is a significant increase from previous years and reflects ongoing economic challenges.

Government Debt:
The analysis showed the constant increase of government debt over the years, it also showed the years with the highest government debt rate. The highest percentage rate of Nigeria's national government debt was 75% in 1991, while the lowest figure was 7.30% in 2008. Between 2008 and 2023, the debt rate grew, going from 7.30% to about 35.58% at the current time. 
Research also showed that the debt keeps on increasing till this present year.

Unemployment Rate
Nigeria's unemployment rate keeps on rising over the years, the analysis showed a significant drop / decline in the rate of unemployment in the year 2019 which was at the rate of 8.53%, It rose from 33.30% in 2020 to 37.7 % in 2022.

The roles our democratic leaders played in Nigeria Economic Growth:

Recommendations for Nigeria's Economic Growth:

1. Diversification of the Economy
Agriculture and Industry Development: The agricultural sector showed significant improvement after 2015, but still lags behind the service and industrial sectors in terms of GDP contribution. Nigeria should continue to invest in the agricultural sector by providing better infrastructure, modern farming techniques, and access to markets for farmers. This will not only boost the sector’s contribution to GDP but also ensure food security and job creation.

Industrialization Focus: The industrial sector has also shown slower growth compared to the services sector. Strengthening industrialization through the provision of affordable energy, improving infrastructure, and encouraging foreign direct investment (FDI) can help increase the competitiveness of Nigerian industries on the global market.

Support for SMEs: Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are essential for job creation and economic diversification. Providing favorable policies, better access to finance, and infrastructure support would help nurture this critical sector.

3. Inflation Control
Monetary Policy Adjustments: Given the high inflation rate, particularly in recent years, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) should focus on controlling inflation through more effective monetary policy tools such as interest rate adjustments and tighter control over the money supply.

Addressing Structural Inflation: Structural factors like supply chain disruptions, import dependency, and domestic production challenges must be addressed. By improving local manufacturing and reducing reliance on imports, Nigeria can reduce inflationary pressure.

Currency Stabilization: The devaluation of the Naira has contributed to inflation. Stabilizing the Naira through strategic foreign exchange policies and boosting reserves can help control inflation and improve consumer confidence.

5. Government Debt Management
Debt Reduction Strategy: With the government debt increasing over the years, Nigeria needs a robust strategy to manage and reduce its national debt. This could include prioritizing debt repayments, reducing non-essential borrowing, and exploring more sustainable funding options such as infrastructure bonds or public-private partnerships (PPPs).

Diversifying Government Revenue: In the face of growing debt, Nigeria should look to diversify its sources of government revenue, reducing over-reliance on oil revenues. Tax reforms to increase collection efficiency, combating tax evasion, and expanding the tax base can provide more sustainable income for the government.

Debt Restructuring: Considering the increasing debt burden, Nigeria should consider negotiating with creditors for debt restructuring or refinancing options that offer more favorable terms.

7. Unemployment Reduction
Youth Employment Programs: Unemployment, especially among the youth, is a significant issue in Nigeria. The government should prioritize job creation through youth employment programs, skills training, and entrepreneurial initiatives. Investing in education and vocational training will also better equip the youth for the demands of the job market.

Encouraging Private Sector Job Creation: Policymakers should focus on creating a business-friendly environment to encourage private sector growth, which is a major source of job creation. Reducing regulatory burdens and enhancing access to finance will allow businesses to expand and employ more people.\

Public Sector Investment in Infrastructure Projects: Large-scale infrastructure projects, including roads, railways, and energy development, could create millions of jobs. This approach has been successful in other countries and could be an effective strategy for Nigeria.

9. Leadership and Governance
Transparent and Accountable Leadership: Effective leadership plays a key role in guiding economic growth. Leaders should focus on implementing transparent policies, strengthening institutions, and ensuring that economic decisions are made with the long-term national interest in mind.

Improving Policy Consistency: There should be a focus on consistency and continuity in economic policies. Frequent changes in economic policies or sudden shifts in direction can create instability and undermine investor confidence. A long-term strategic plan, with clear milestones and regular reviews, would promote stability.

Capacity Building for Leadership: Effective leadership requires an understanding of both domestic challenges and global economic trends. Investment in leadership training and capacity building, particularly for public sector managers, could lead to more effective governance.

11. Fostering the Services Sector
Investment in Technology and Innovation: The services sector, particularly in telecommunications, finance, and IT, is crucial to Nigeria’s GDP. Promoting innovation through policies that support tech startups, fintech, and digital economy initiatives can foster significant growth in this sector.

Improving Education and Skill Development: A growing services sector requires a highly skilled workforce. Nigeria must invest in higher education, particularly in fields related to technology, finance, and management, to create a labor force that can meet the demands of an increasingly complex economy.
